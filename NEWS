                   User-Visible pam-afs-session Changes

pam-afs-session 0.1 (2006-11-10)

    Initial beta release.

    Supports libkafs and libkopenafs in theory, but only the internal
    syscall layer has been tested.  No man page yet, and the program to
    run to obtain tokens must be specified in the PAM options.
