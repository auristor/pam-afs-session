                   User-Visible pam-afs-session Changes

pam-afs-session 0.2 (unreleased)

    Add an always_aklog option saying to always run aklog even if the user
    doesn't appear to have a ticket cache.

    Reopen stdout and stderr to /dev/null before running aklog so that any
    error messages from aklog don't confuse the calling program.

pam-afs-session 0.1 (2006-11-10)

    Initial beta release.

    Supports libkafs and libkopenafs in theory, but only the internal
    syscall layer has been tested.  No man page yet, and the program to
    run to obtain tokens must be specified in the PAM options.
