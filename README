BLURB

  pam-afs-session is a PAM module intended for use with a Kerberos v5 PAM
  module to obtain an AFS PAG and AFS tokens on login.  It puts every new
  session in a PAG regardless of whether it was authenticated with
  Kerberos and runs a configurable external program to obtain tokens.  It
  supports using Heimdal's libkafs for the AFS interface and falls back to
  an internal Linux-only implementation if libkafs isn't available.

DESCRIPTION

  pam-afs-session is a PAM module that isolates each login in a separate
  AFS PAG (so that they will not trample on each other's AFS tokens) and
  supports running an external program to obtain AFS tokens from a
  Kerberos v5 ticket cache.  It does not obtain tickets itself and must be
  used in conjunction with a Kerberos v5 PAM module to obtain tokens
  (setting up PAGs can be done without any Kerberos implementations).  It
  provides only the setcred and session PAM functions.

  For the AFS system call layer, pam-afs-session supports linking with the
  Heimdal libkafs library or the libkopenafs library that will ship with
  later versions of OpenAFS and provides a similar interface.  As a
  fallback, and to support a low-dependency build, it also comes with a
  simple AFS system call implementation for either Linux or platforms that
  use syscall to call AFS functions.  To use the built-in system call
  interface on Linux, the system must run a new enough version of OpenAFS
  or Arla to support AFS system calls through ioctl on a file in proc.  On
  other systems, configure must be able to find the AFS header afs/param.h
  in order to get the system call numbers for that platform.

  Right now, this module will probably only work on Linux and Solaris, and
  will require gcc to even attempt to build on any other platform.  Other
  PAM implementations will likely require some porting work.

COMPILING AND INSTALLING

  To build the module, just run:

      ./configure
      make

  By default, the first aklog program found on the PATH will be compiled
  into the module as the default aklog program to run.  This can be
  overridden by the program PAM option.  To specify an explicit path to
  aklog, use:

      ./configure --with-aklog=/path/to/aklog

  instead.

  On Solaris, expect a warning about a type mismatch for pam_get_user.
  This warning should be harmless.

  To install the module into /usr/local/lib/security and the man page into
  /usr/local/share/man/man5, run:

      make install

  You can change the installation locations with the --prefix, --mandir,
  and --libdir options to configure.  The module will be installed in a
  subdirectory of $libdir named security.  Alternately, you can simply
  copy pam_afs_session.so to whatever directory you use for PAM modules.
  On Solaris, you will need to make the module executable.

  If you are building this module without libkafs on a platform other than
  Linux, configure needs to find the AFS header afs/param.h.  If this is
  not in the normal include path, pass the --with-afs-headers option to
  configure to point the compiler at the correct path.  For example, if
  your AFS headers are in /usr/afsws/include, run:

      ./configure --with-afs-headers=/usr/afsws/include

  instead.

  You can pass the --enable-reduced-depends flag to configure to try to
  minimize the shared library dependencies encoded in the binaries.  This
  omits from the link line all the libraries included solely because
  libkafs or the Kerberos libraries depend on them and instead links the
  programs only against libraries whose APIs are called directly.  This
  will only work with shared libraries and will only work on platforms
  where shared libraries properly encode their own dependencies (such as
  Linux).  It is intended primarily for building packages for Linux
  distributions to avoid encoding unnecessary shared library dependencies
  that make shared library migrations more difficult.  If none of the
  above made any sense to you, don't bother with this flag.

CONFIGURING

  Just installing the module does not enable it or change anything about
  your system authentication configuration.  To use it in conjunction with
  pam_krb5 on a Debian system, put something like:

      auth  [success=ok default=1]  pam_krb5.so
      auth  [default=done]          pam_afs_session.so program=/usr/bin/aklog
      auth  required                pam_unix.so try_first_pass nullok_secure

  in /etc/pam.d/common-auth and something like:

      session  optional  pam_krb5.so
      session  required  pam_afs_session.so program=/usr/bin/aklog

  in /etc/pam.d/common-session.  The program= setting is optional if
  /usr/bin/aklog was in your path when the module was compiled or was
  specified via the --with-aklog option to configure.

  You may want to stack your Kerberos v5 PAM module and the Unix module
  differently, but note that this module should always run after the
  Kerberos v5 PAM module.  If there is no ticket cache available in the
  PAM environment, it will succeed silently.

  Note that this is not an authentication module and will always return
  success to any authentication attempt, so never make this module
  sufficient in your authentication stack.  It's only listed as an auth
  module because it provides a pam_setcred implementation and some
  programs need to call pam_setcred rather than pam_open_session (screen
  savers, for instance, to refresh credentials).

  On Red Hat systems, modify /etc/pam.d/system-auth instead; it contains
  all of the configuration for the different stacks.  For Solaris console
  login, add something like:

      login session required /usr/local/lib/security/pam_afs_session.so 
          minimum_uid=100 retain_after_close

  (all on one line) in /etc/pam.conf.  Note that, on Solaris, if you want
  authentication to first try Kerberos v5 and then fall back to regular
  Unix authentication, you probably cannot include this module in the auth
  stack (for pam_setcred).  Solaris doesn't support the [] keywords that
  Linux PAM does.  However, including it in the session stack should be
  sufficient; most well-behaved applications will open a session as well
  as calling pam-setcred.  See the man page for pam.conf on Solaris for
  more configuration information.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

  pam-afs-session supports three basic usage patterns: creating a new
  session using either pam_open_session or pam_setcred(PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED)
  (or both), closing a session with pam_close_session or
  pam_setcred(PAM_DELETE_CRED), and refreshing credentials with
  pam_setcred(PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED).  In general, the same behavior
  occurs whether using the pam_*_session interface or the pam_setcred
  interface, since some PAM-using programs call one and some call the
  other.  In all cases, pam-afs-session will log an error and then
  successfully exit if AFS doesn't appear to be running (checked with the
  k_hasafs interface).

  pam-afs-session stores a PAM data key named "pam_afs_session" once it
  has successfully created a PAG and a token.  If this key is present in
  the PAM data when pam_open_session or pam_setcred with the
  PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED flag is called, it will successfully do nothing to
  keep from doing duplicate work.  Otherwise, it will always create a PAG
  and then will run an external program to obtain tokens provided that the
  environment variable KRB5CCNAME is set in the PAM environment.

  When pam_close_session or pam_setcred(PAM_DELETE_CRED) is called,
  pam-afs-session will destroy the user's tokens only if the PAM data key
  "pam_afs_session" is present (meaning that pam-afs-session previously
  obtained tokens).  This check is present to avoid deleting tokens when
  session initialization failed, since in that case no new PAG may have
  been created and we may be deleting tokens that are not ours to delete.

  pam_setcred(PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED) is treated similarly to the opening
  of a new session except that no PAG is created.  Instead, only the
  program to obtain tokens is run, provided that KRB5CCNAME is set in the
  PAM environment.  This interface is used by programs such as screen
  savers and lockers to refresh a user's credentials.

  pam-afs-session requires that the user (obtained via pam_get_user)
  exists in the local passwd file or equivalent (using getpwnam) and runs
  the external program under that user's UID and primary GID.

THANKS

  Some of the ideas behind this PAM module (although not the code) are
  taken from the libpam-openafs-session Debian package written by Sam
  Hartman and the pam_afs2 module written by Douglas Engart.  Thanks to
  both of them for their previous work.  Any errors in this implementation
  are mine.

  The Linux system call layer was based on inspection of the code in
  OpenAFS and on discussions with Jeffrey Hutzelman on how best to
  implement an AFS system call layer and on how the pieces work.  I
  couldn't have written this code without his explanations.

  Thanks to Douglas Engart for an initial code review, for Solaris
  porting, for suggesting the always_aklog and aklog_homedir options, and
  for catching various other problems and missing features.

  Thanks to Sean O'Malley for additional Solaris porting information and
  for testing with the Sun C compiler.
