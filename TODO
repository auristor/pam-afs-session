                        pam-afs-session To-Do List

 * When logging on using OpenSSH with GSSAPI authentication, the
   open_session function is run properly but at the end of the connection,
   OpenSSH apparently runs pam_setcred(PAM_DELETE_CRED) to clean up and
   pam-afs-session doesn't think that it had created a token initially.
   Dig into this and try to understand what's going on.
