PAM API:

 * Tighter verification that all of our flags are valid might be a good

 * Double-check the return statuses of all of the PAM API functions to
   ensure that they're within the documented and permitted set.

Configuration:

 * Consider defaulting to nopag on Mac OS X and any other platform where
   we know PAGs cannot be supported.
