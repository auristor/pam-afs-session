                        pam-afs-session To-Do List

General:

 * Add support for k_haspag and recreation of the PAG and tokens even if
   the module has already run if there is no longer a PAG.

 * Providing a way to pass command-line arguments to the aklog program
   would be nice, even if not strictly necessary.  If set in krb5.conf,
   one should be able to just use spaces.  PAM options will require some
   other workaround (maybe using commas).

AFS System Calls:

 * Support the ioctl calls used on Mac OS X and Solaris 11 in the kafs
   portability layer.

PAM API:

 * Tighter verification that all of our flags are valid might be a good
   idea.

 * Double-check the return statuses of all of the PAM API functions to
   ensure that they're within the documented and permitted set.

Build System:

 * Fix probe for krb5_afslog and test that code.

Tests:

 * Add a test case for k_hasafs failure, using a fake kafs library.  With
   that fake library, also test that k_setpag is called correctly.
