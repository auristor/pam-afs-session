                        pam-afs-session To-Do List

 * Write a man page that documents all of the configuration options.

 * When logging on using OpenSSH with GSSAPI authentication, the
   open_session function is run properly but at the end of the connection,
   OpenSSH apparently runs pam_setcred(PAM_DELETE_CRED) to clean up and
   pam-afs-session doesn't think that it had created a token initially.
   Dig into this and try to understand what's going on.

 * Provide a compile-time default for the external program to run to
   obtain tokens so that program doesn't always have to be specified.
   We'll probably then also need a way to say not to obtain tokens and
   only create PAGs.

 * Support using the libkafs functions to obtain tokens rather than
   spawning an external aklog.  This will require some additional
   configuration options to control which cells in which to get tokens
   (aklog handles that for us).

 * Support systems that don't handle transitive shared library
   dependencies by figuring out the dependencies of libkafs and linking
   with them explicitly (and adding --enable-reduced-depends to say to not
   do this for packaging).

 * Support linking with Kerberos libraries to get the appdefault functions
   and using them to read options out of krb5.conf rather than only from
   the PAM configuration.

 * Review the AFS-related PAM options in the Sourceforge PAM module and
   support the ones that make sense here.

 * Port to Solaris.

 * Possibly port to HP-UX, which requires reworking how the aklog
   environment is handled since HP-UX pam doesn't support the
   pam_getenvlist function.  pam_afs2 has code to handle this.
