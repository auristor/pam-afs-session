                        pam-afs-session To-Do List

 * When logging on using OpenSSH with GSSAPI authentication, the
   open_session function is run properly but at the end of the connection,
   OpenSSH apparently runs pam_setcred(PAM_DELETE_CRED) to clean up and
   pam-afs-session doesn't think that it had created a token initially.
   Dig into this and try to understand what's going on.

 * Add configuration to specify which cells in which to get tokens and
   pass this into either aklog or libkafs as appropriate.

 * Review the AFS-related PAM options in the Sourceforge PAM module and
   support the ones that make sense here.

 * Possibly port to HP-UX, which requires reworking how the aklog
   environment is handled since HP-UX pam doesn't support the
   pam_getenvlist function.  pam_afs2 has code to handle this.
