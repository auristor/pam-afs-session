                        pam-afs-session To-Do List

 * Providing a way to pass command-line arguments to the aklog program
   would be nice, even if not strictly necessary.  If set in krb5.conf,
   one should be able to just use spaces.  PAM options will require some
   other workaround (maybe using ! to separate arguments or something).

 * All of the option parsing code does not deal clealy with failure to
   allocate memory.  Generally, we just don't set the parameter.  This may
   not always be safe, or may lead to unexpected behavior.  We should
   always check memory allocation failures and abort PAM if we see any.
   Unfortunately, the profile library doesn't return errors on memory
   allocation failure, which makes this mostly futile until there's a
   better profile library API.

 * Add a test suite.  If the user already has an AFS token, it should be
   fairly straightforward to test PAG creation.  Testing running an
   external token program based on KRB5CCNAME is very straightforward.
   Testing ticket cache destruction probably requires that the tester
   already have a ticket cache.  We can fake a k_hasafs() failure by
   selectively linking object files with a fake implementation.
