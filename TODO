                        pam-afs-session To-Do List

 * Providing a way to pass command-line arguments to the aklog program
   would be nice, even if not strictly necessary.  If set in krb5.conf,
   one should be able to just use spaces.  PAM options will require some
   other workaround (maybe using ! to separate arguments or something).

 * All of the option parsing code does not deal clealy with failure to
   allocate memory.  Generally, we just don't set the parameter.  This may
   not always be safe, or may lead to unexpected behavior.  We should
   always check memory allocation failures and abort PAM if we see any.
   Unfortunately, the profile library doesn't return errors on memory
   allocation failure, which makes this mostly futile until there's a
   better profile library API.
