                        pam-afs-session To-Do List

General:

 * Providing a way to pass command-line arguments to the aklog program
   would be nice, even if not strictly necessary.  If set in krb5.conf,
   one should be able to just use spaces.  PAM options will require some
   other workaround (maybe using commas).

PAM API:

 * Tighter verification that all of our flags are valid might be a good
   idea.

 * Double-check the return statuses of all of the PAM API functions to
   ensure that they're within the documented and permitted set.

Tests:

 * Add a test case for k_hasafs failure, using a fake kafs library.
