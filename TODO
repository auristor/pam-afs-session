                        pam-afs-session To-Do List

Portability:

 * Mac OS X Lion ships with Heimdal Kerberos with an MIT Kerberos
   compatibility shim on top of it, and the latter does not implement
   krb5_appdefault_*.  This means that pam-afs-session cannot get
   configuration from krb5.conf on Mac OS X Lion.  Find a way to link
   directly to the underlying Heimdal libraries so that the module can
   call the real krb5_appdefault_* functions.

Testing:

 * Add support for setting an environment variable to the fakepam testing
   library and use that to test behavior when KRB5CCNAME is only set in
   the PAM environment, not the general environment.

 * Add sufficient hook support to allow testing all of the output in the
   module/pag test while still checking the PAG status and changing
   internal state at each point.
