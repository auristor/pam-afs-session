                        pam-afs-session To-Do List

 * When logging on using OpenSSH with GSSAPI authentication, the
   open_session function is run properly but at the end of the connection,
   OpenSSH apparently runs pam_setcred(PAM_DELETE_CRED) to clean up and
   pam-afs-session doesn't think that it had created a token initially.
   Dig into this and try to understand what's going on.

 * Provide a way to say not to obtain tokens and only create PAGs.

 * Support using the libkafs functions to obtain tokens rather than
   spawning an external aklog.  This will require some additional
   configuration options to control which cells in which to get tokens
   (aklog handles that for us).

 * Support linking with Kerberos libraries to get the appdefault functions
   and using them to read options out of krb5.conf rather than only from
   the PAM configuration.

 * Review the AFS-related PAM options in the Sourceforge PAM module and
   support the ones that make sense here.

 * Possibly port to HP-UX, which requires reworking how the aklog
   environment is handled since HP-UX pam doesn't support the
   pam_getenvlist function.  pam_afs2 has code to handle this.
