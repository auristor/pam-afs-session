libpam-afs-session (1.7-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Install a pam-auth-update profile for pam_afs_session that runs it
    from the additional section during both auth and session.  Thanks,
    Nate Coraor.  (Closes: #523796)

    needed for upgrades from etch to lenny.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to dependencies.
  * Change section to admin to match override.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.1 (no changes required).

libpam-afs-session (1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Return PAM_IGNORE when AFS isn't available and when functions are
      skipped due to the configuration.
    - Set explicit hidden visibility for all local symbols and further
      restrict the visible symbols with a version script, removing leaks
      of symbols into the application namespace.
  * Install NEWS as the upstream changelog.  Upstream no longer includes a
    detailed CHANGES file.
  * Add a Homepage control field.
  * Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.0 (no changes required).

libpam-afs-session (1.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recommend openafs-client rather than depend on it.  All the module
    truly requires is that the kernel module be loaded, which isn't what
    openafs-client provides.  Users may be using a separately built
    OpenAFS package or Arla.
