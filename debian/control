Description: PAM module to set up a PAG and obtain AFS tokens
 AFS is a distributed network file system.  It uses in-kernel credentials
 (AFS tokens) obtained from Kerberos tickets for authentication and access
 control, and controls access to those credentials via PAGs (process
 authentication groups).  This module provides a PAM session
 implementation that puts new logins in separate PAGs and optionally runs
 an external program (usually aklog) to obtain tokens from Kerberos
 tickets.  It is designed to work with a Kerberos PAM module that obtains
 the initial Kerberos tickets.
