#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files on
# Debian, and should contain a list of modules that define tasks to be
# performed at the start and end of sessions of *any* kind (both interactive
# and non-interactive).
#
# Manage Kerberos credentials, create an AFS PAG and get a token if
# appropriate, and then handle the regular Unix session.
