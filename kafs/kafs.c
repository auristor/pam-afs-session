/*
 * kafs replacement, main API.
 *
 * This is a simple implementation of the k_hasafs, k_setpag, and k_unlog
 * functions.  It is for use on systems that don't have libkafs or
 * libkopenafs, or where a dependency on those libraries is not desirable for
 * some reason.
 *
 * A more robust implementation of the full kafs interface would have a
 * separate header file with the various system call constants and would
 * support more operations and the k_pioctl interface.  Since this is a
 * stripped-down implementation with only the few functions to do PAG
 * management, various interface constants and system call numbers are
 * hard-coded here.
