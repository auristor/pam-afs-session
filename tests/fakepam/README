The files in this directory provide a shim PAM library that's used for
testing.  This library and its include files define the minimum amount of
the PAM module interface so that PAM modules can be tested without such
problems as needing configuration files in /etc/pam.d or needing changes
to the system configuration to run a testing PAM module instead of the
normal system PAM modules.

In order to be tested with the code here, source files should support
multiple compilation against either the system PAM libraries or the files
here.  To do that, change the include of <portable/pam.h> to:

    #ifdef TESTING
    # include <fakepam/api.h>
    #else
    # include <portable/pam.h>
    #endif

The goal of this library is that all other code should be able to be left
unchanged.
