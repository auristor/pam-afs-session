The files in this directory provide a shim PAM library that's used for
testing.  This library and its include files define the minimum amount of
the PAM module interface so that PAM modules can be tested without such
problems as needing configuration files in /etc/pam.d or needing changes
to the system configuration to run a testing PAM module instead of the
normal system PAM modules.

The goal of this library is that all PAM code should be able to be left
unchanged and the code just linked with the fakepam library rather than
the regular PAM library.  The testing code can then call pam_start and
pam_end as defind in the fakepam/testing.h header file and inspect
internal PAM state as needed.
